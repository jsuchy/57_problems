# Problem 2 - Counting Number of Characters

Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string plus the number of characters the string contains

Example: "House" -> "House has 5 characters"

## Constraints
* Make sure the output contains the original string
* Use a single output statement to construct the output
* Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string

## Extra Challenges:
* If the user enters nothing, state that they must enter something
* Implement this program using a graphical interface and update the character counter every time a key is pressed. If your language doesn't have a particularly friendly GUI library, try doing this with HTML and JavaScript instead.
